He gives the boy, Diego, a grenade, holds the ignition mechanism down and pulls out the pen. This is how, he explains, people are: obedient as long as you have a firm grip on them. But if you are too careless with them, then ... Boom. With this lesson, El Presidente aims to harden his son and prepare him for the succession of his brutal regime. It is refreshing that he is not shown as a black and white villain: He has reasons for his behavior, which at least for him are reasonable: that the people need a firm hold if they are not to get loud, bloody and a little short of breath underpinned by the existence of resistance. And thats where you come in.;http://localhost/dhbw/ludomo/assets/images/far-cry-6-pc-spiel-ubisoft-connect-europe-cover.jpg;5;1
